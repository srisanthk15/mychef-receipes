After uploading the new cookbook, they wonder why they are\nstill receiving email.\n\nThe issue that chef is great for describing actions.  I mean, *action* is part\nof the DSL.\n\nAt the 2013 Opscode Communit Summit, Matt Ray and I had a discussion regarding\nthis issue.  The name *authoritative cookbook* was coined.  If chef is deploying\nfiles to a .d directory, if there are files in that directory not converged by a\nresource, those files should be removed.\n\nThis pattern has been added to https://github.com/Youscribe/sysctl-cookbook\n\nI presented the zap pattern at ChefConf 2014.
